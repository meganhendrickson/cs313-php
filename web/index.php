<h1>Well, Hello There!</h1>
<p>Allow me to introduce myslef: Im a designer-developer-in-training and a chocolate lover.
  I like to perfect every detail, put puzzles together, laugh at silly jokes, cry over bad design, 
  and take walks in the sunshine. I'm still figuring out what I am doing with my life. But hey, 
  nice to meet you!
